The Markdown should document and justify (based on tidy data principles) the transformations on the data, while the code should be a well-designed set of functions allowing repeatable results, and called in a structured way.\n",

And the class discussion of the source dataset and the assignment description will give you advice to help you in this process.

    "So your Project assignments are not just about \"writing the program\".  I want you, through the Markdown and Notebook, as well as the visualization, to **clearly communicate** all of your steps in the start-to-finish progression and what you **learned about the datasets**.  As outlined in the rubric below, your grade is about all of these parts.\n",

So the end of the notebook will be including the graphs/visualizations developed in Tableau and leading the reader through the interpretation.\n",

    "Your grade will be determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 25 points for a well written and coherent essay and visualizations that answer good questions about the data\n",
    "- 17 points for code that executes correctly, and is structured with good functional decomposition and limits/eliminates globals\n",
    "  - I and my TAs must be able to load your notebook and do a \"Restart and Run All\" execution and get execution that correctly starts with no data in the local directory, and ends with a file (or files) that serves as a correct Data Connection in Tableau to your visualization.\n",
    "- 8 points for code documentation.  The code documentation **must** include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Program level docstring\n",
    "  - Complete docstrings for each function that include description, parameters, and return value\n",
    "      - If you have insufficient functions defined, you will lose these potential points as well\n",
