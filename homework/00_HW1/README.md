# README for Homework 00_HW1

There are three goals for this homework:

1. To practice some CS1 level Python in the context of a Jupyter notebook, with a structure similar to what you will be seeing in homeworks throughout the semester.  Namely, a repetition of the three cell sequence of
    - a question, documented in a Markdown cell,
    - a code cell with a designated place for you to code your solution, called the *solution cell*
    - a *checking cell* with one or more checks and assertions to see if your solution works, at some level.
2. To practice with Markdown, by asking you to create a new notebook that uses the basic annotations of Markdown to reproduce a desired formatted target.
3. To do some reading questions associated with the reading expected for the same date when this homework is due.  Each of these questions has a cell asking the question, followed by a cell where you will use **markdown** to document your answer.  Your answer should be clear and well formatted, to the extent necessary.  There are no "checking cells" for these questions.

Toward these three goals, you will work through the three provided notebooks of this homework:

- `python_practice.ipynb`: Here you will edit this notebook, in place, adding your solutions and saving the result.
- `markdown_practice_instructions.ipynb`: This notebook is just instructions.  By following these instructions, you will create a new notebook, named `target.ipynb` that contains your solution.
- `files_rq.ipynb`: Here, you will edit this notebook, in place, adding your solutions and saving the result.

When you are done with the assignment, you will submit your assignment in Notebowl by uploading, separately, the three files:

- `python_practice.ipynb`
- `target.ipynb`
- `files_rq.ipynb`

You will lose points if you put these into a zip or other archive, or if they are not named **exactly** as specified.  If you have a number appended to the name of a file, that is usually a sign that your are **not** using `git pull` or equivalent and are manually downloading files from the class repository onto your laptop.  See your TA during open hours, or your instructor during office hours to figure out anything that you are missing or do not understand.
