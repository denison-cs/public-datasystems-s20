    "    - The `action` attribute of the form determines the resource path, relative to the current location, for the URI/resource path needed in the HTTP POST\n",
    "    - The \"form\", in this case, just consists of a dropdown list, whose entries are given by the sequence of `option` nodes, and whose values are the possible years.  The key for this field is called `year`, as given in the `select` node.  The value will be one of the year values.\n",
    "    - The `input` node determines the submission of the form.  In this case, when the user clicks the `\"Get different year\"`, the form will be submitted and, in addition to the key=value items from the form items, the `name` of the `input` attribute, `newYear` will be mapped to the `value` of \"Get different year\"."

    "1. We must invoke a POST request instead of a GET request.\n",
    "2. The request must include a body that consists of key-value pairs.\n",

The requests module is very flexible in how it interprets an argument provided through `data`.  If it is a string, it simply puts the encoded bytes of the string in the body.  If it is a dictionary, it interprets it and generates a URL-encoded version, as we will see below:"
